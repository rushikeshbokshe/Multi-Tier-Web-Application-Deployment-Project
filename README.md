Key Terraform Modules Developed

VPC Module - Multi-AZ networking with public/private subnets
ECS Module - Fargate service with auto-scaling and service discovery
RDS Module - PostgreSQL with automated backups and read replicas
Security Module - IAM roles, security groups, and WAF rules
Monitoring Module - CloudWatch alarms and dashboards

State Management

Remote state stored in S3 with DynamoDB locking
Separate state files for each environment (dev/staging/prod)
State encryption at rest and in transit

Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
Pipeline Architecture
GitHub Webhook → Jenkins → Build → Test → Security Scan → Deploy
                     ↓
                 Docker Build → ECR Push → ECS Deploy
Pipeline Stages

Source Control Integration - GitHub webhook triggers on PR/merge
Build Stage - Maven/npm build with dependency caching
Unit Testing - Jest/JUnit tests with coverage reporting
Security Scanning - SonarQube code analysis and OWASP dependency check
Docker Build - Multi-stage Dockerfile optimization
Registry Push - ECR image push with semantic versioning
Infrastructure Validation - Terraform plan and validate
Deployment - Blue/green deployment to ECS with health checks
Integration Testing - Automated API and UI tests post-deployment
Notification - Slack/email notifications with deployment status

Jenkins Configuration Highlights

Distributed builds - Master-agent architecture with 3 build agents
Pipeline as Code - Jenkinsfile stored in source control
Parallel execution - Build, test, and security scanning run in parallel
Artifact management - Nexus repository for build artifacts
Credential management - HashiCorp Vault integration for secret management

AWS Implementation
Networking

VPC Design - Multi-AZ setup across 3 availability zones
Subnet Strategy - Public subnets for ALB, private subnets for applications
Security Groups - Principle of least privilege with specific port access
Route Tables - Separate routing for public and private subnets

Compute and Containers

ECS Fargate - Serverless container deployment with auto-scaling
Service Discovery - AWS Cloud Map for internal service communication
Load Balancing - ALB with health checks and sticky sessions
Auto Scaling - Target tracking based on CPU and memory utilization

Database and Storage

RDS PostgreSQL - Multi-AZ with automated backups and encryption
ElastiCache Redis - Session storage and application caching
S3 Buckets - Static asset hosting with versioning and lifecycle policies
EFS - Shared file system for application logs and temporary files

Monitoring and Logging

CloudWatch - Custom metrics, alarms, and log aggregation
AWS X-Ray - Distributed tracing for performance optimization
ELK Stack - Centralized logging with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
Prometheus/Grafana - Additional monitoring for container metrics

Security Implementation
Infrastructure Security

IAM Roles - Service-specific roles with minimal required permissions
Secrets Management - AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials
Network Security - Private subnets, NACLs, and security group restrictions
Encryption - At-rest and in-transit encryption for all data stores

Application Security

WAF Rules - Protection against common web attacks (OWASP Top 10)

Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: State File Conflicts
Problem: Multiple team members working on Terraform caused state file conflicts
Solution: Implemented Terraform Cloud with remote state locking and team-based access controls
Challenge 2: Blue/Green Deployment Complexity
Problem: Zero-downtime deployments were complex with database migrations
Solution: Implemented backward-compatible database changes and feature flags for gradual rollouts
Challenge 3: Cost Management
Problem: Initial AWS costs exceeded budget by 40%
Solution: Implemented cost monitoring with CloudWatch billing alarms, right-sized instances, and reserved capacity planning
Challenge 4: Security Compliance
Problem: Meeting SOC 2 compliance requirements
Solution: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline, implemented AWS Config rules, and created compliance dashboards
Monitoring and Alerting
Key Metrics Tracked

Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk usage, network throughput
Application: API response times, error rates, transaction volumes
Business: User registrations, order completions, revenue metrics
Security: Failed login attempts, suspicious traffic patterns
